# About
Inspired by jpdb.io, which offers extensive details on the number of kanjis and characters in novels, visual novels, and anime, this project was created to address a missing pieceâ€”comprehensive data on mangas.


# Data sources
- Mokuro Files: We parse publicly available mokuro files to extract text data.
- Anilist API: Manga metadata is fetched via the Anilist API, enhancing the dataset with rich contextual information.

# Okay this is cool but where do I view it?
